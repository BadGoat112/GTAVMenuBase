# GTA V Menu   

This menu base was taken from SudoMod once, but I changed things here and there and now I want to use it in multiple projects so it'll just exist here or whatever.

## Building

### Requirements
* [ScriptHookV SDK by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)

You'll wanna have this repo cloned to your git folder along with where you store your projects. All of my GTA V projects that use a menu (this menu) consume it in the same way, by having something like `-I../../GTAVMenuBase/` and `-I../../ScriptHookV_SDK/` in their VS Project files.

* [Manual Transmission](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission)
* [Addon Spawner](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVAddonLoader)
* [VStancer](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVStancer)
* [Real Time Handling Editor](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVHandlingEditor)

Since native functions are used, ScriptHookV is needed.
